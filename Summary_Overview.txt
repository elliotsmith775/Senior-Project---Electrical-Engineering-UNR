Desert Rain is an irrigation controller system primarily intended for residential applications.
The design includes a control unit to be installed indoors, as well as an expandable stake 
design with remote stakes transmitting the current soil conditions. The lithium-ion battery
powered stakes with solar charging circuitry communicate via wireless 2.4GHz mesh networking,
transmitting the soil moisture content as well as the atmospheric temperature, humidity and pressure 
measured at each stake. 
Using the information provided by the stakes, the controller can run
up to five different sprinkler zones using conventional 24VAC irrigation solenoid valves.
By monitoring soil status, the irrigation system will optimize watering durations and watering 
days based on soil moisture data stored over time.  Learning from previous data and assigning the optimal 
irrigation schedule for maximal growth while decreasing water consumption.  
The direct advantage of such monitoring will be greater growth coupled with less water usage and
chemical runoff related to overwatering.  The complete design by G6 Solutions includes custom PCBs 
for the controllers and stakes, ABS plastic stake housings, and an ABS plastic controller housing
with user interface and LCD. In a world facing a global drought, DesertRain can help reduce 
irrigation water waste.
